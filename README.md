## Project Motivation

The motivation of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting whether Starbucks users will convert with certain offers. For this, data on offers, transactions and socioeconomics of starbucks customers are available for a defined period.   

In addition, some analyzes were performed to generate insights in relation to this data. In this way, it was possible to extract relevant insights about the participants of these offers.

## File Descriptions

Files:
* offer_predict.ipynb: notebook with the analyses, transformations and the final model
* data: folder with the data provided by Starbucks on udacity
* img: Images of the main analyzes

## How to Interact with the project

The entire project is in the [notebook](https://github.com/tadeucbm/Starbucks-Capstone/blob/main/offer_predict.ipynb). You just need to install the necessary libraries in requirementx.txt and run the notebook.   

Furthermore, the results were described in [this post in the medium](https://medium.com/@tadeucbmad/starbucks-study-case-how-to-predict-whether-your-customers-will-use-your-offers-9d97f7fcd1b1).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank udacity for the whole process in this nanodegree. This final project was extremely important to improve my knowledge in the pipeline of a Data Science project.
